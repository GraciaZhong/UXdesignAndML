                The

                    hope,

            <p>The highest keyword is “realdonaldtrump.” People strongly focus on the U.S. president's action and policy

        <div class="asia_text">
            <h2>Asia</h2>

            <p>Throughout his presidential election campaign in 2016, Trump accused Asian nations of ‘taking advantage’
                of the US through unfair trade policies and general reluctance to provide for their own security. <em class="rf">(Kolmaš &
                Kolmašová, 2019)</em>.
            </p>
            <p>As the presidency unfolds, Trump has switched away from these campaign threats in favour of good
                diplomatic relations with the Koreans and Japanese. The frequent U-turns in his
                position can hardly indicate rationalism based on calculation of national benefits.
                <em class="hl">His rhetoric isbased on pragmatic logic, which rests on given political circumstances and
                    their subjective assessment
                    through personal experience.</em>
                While his statements have been criticized as inconsistent and
                incomprehensive, pragmatism provides a persuasive explanation of his rhetoric.
                Trump’s pragmatic policies make use of a rising China to promote American interests
                in Asia. Contrary to Trump,
                <em class="hl">Obama’s multilateral approach to Asia was based on a norm-based vocabulary calling for
                    freedom,
                    democracy, rule of law and increased cooperation.</em> Obama was very active in promoting and
                cooperating in
                institutions throughout Asia and initiated a set of agreements to foster American leadership there.
                However, the lofty rhetoric and multilateral initiative only marginally translated into practical
                policies and did not do much to ease tensions in East and Southeast Asia.<em class="rf">(Kolmaš & Kolmašová,

        <h2 class="title_final"> Conclusion</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="sum">
        <h3> Social Impact</h3>
        <p>Barack Obama still exerts a powerful impact on communication networks, even though he completed the
            presidential job a long time ago.
            Moreover, these studies demonstrates that key players, such as Donald Trump,
            Barack Obama, African organizations, and the BBC, are located in the central networks. <em class="rf">(Yum, 2020)</em>
        </p>
        <h3> Counterfactual Advocacy in Twitter</h3>
        <p>Too many posts and too many links also consist of counterfactual advocacy, which Steven Goldzwig defines
            as "a discourse designed to deny, evade, or misdirect its audiences from facts, inferences, or
            descriptions of events" necessary for constructive, democratic decision making. <em class="rf">(Robinson, 2017,
            as cited in Bostdorff, 2017)</em>
            Research shows that the top 20 "fake-news" stories in the last three months of the 2016 campaign received
            more reactions, shares, and comments than the top 20 actual news stories. 
            Across time, presidential candidates like them have read their environments for the rhetorical valences
            that Stuckey identifies and have used their discourse to put audiences in the proper emotional frame of
            mind to support their candidacies and the change they advocate. <em class="rf">(Bostdorff, 2017)</em>
